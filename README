Example
=======

If you have a model with tree structure (the model must has a column name parent_id), you can simple invoke 

<%= build_tree_view(model, attribute name) %> from the view.

The attributes name is the name of the attribute that you want to display on the tree node.

If you are using other name instead of parent_id in your database, you can simple set the parent_name to whatever you call it on your database, such as 
build_tree_view(model, attribute name, :parent_name => 'parent')
